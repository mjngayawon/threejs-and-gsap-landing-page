# 📱 Apple iPhone Landing Page

This is a clone of Apple's iPhone 15 Pro website using **React.js** and **TailwindCSS**. It highlights the effective use of **GSAP (Greensock Animations)** and **Three.js** for displaying iPhone 15 Pro models in various colors and shapes. This project is created to improve and strengthen my Tailwind CSS skills and creating modern and **responsive** ReactJS websites. It is also a good introduction of learning Three.js and GSAP.
